This directory contains a few jQuery versions.
The management back-end uses the interface plug-in which is replaced by the official jQuery UI plug-in.
So it's necessary to replace this code, but there are some bugs if we only change the scripts, so some of the
management script have to be rewritten, until that we need these versions

jQuery 1.1.2 (jquery112.js)
This is used for full support the interface plugin (especially sliders), there are some bugs with newer versions.

jQuery 1.1.3.1 (jquery.js)
most used version, this was the newest version when the management-scripts were written.

jQuery 1.2.6 (jquery-1.2.6.min.js)
newest version which supports the jQuery UI plugin



jQuery UI 1.0 (jquery/ui/old)
this was used to fix a sortable bug in the asn page

jQuery UI 1.5 (jquery/ui)
the newest jQuery-UI Suite
